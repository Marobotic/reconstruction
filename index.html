                <p class="top_text">Aion RP is an artistic endeavour by fans of the original game
                    to recreate what Aion seemed to develop into in its early years.
                    We’ve tasked ourselves with reworking early content and broken systems
                    according to lore and modern standards of gameplay in order
                    to deliver a serene immersive experience in a coherent believable world.
                    We are making a PvE Role-Play server where you can come to relax and escape. </p>

                    <p>Many of this game’s problems stem from it originally being a subscription-based mmo. The more time

                        cranny of it. We identify these and other unfun things in the game and fundamentally rework them
                        from the ground up. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>• Increased basic movement and flight speed to that of endgame values. You no longer need boots
                            to run fast. Buffs, debuffs and gear stats have been scaled accordingly. Monster speeds have been
                            bumped up to match player speed aswell, causing the game to start feeling much less janky overall.
                            This change also makes it viable to make tall and human-proportioned characters, as now their
                            running animation works at quite a satisfying speed.
                            •Removed title stats in order to make titles purely cosmetic. Player stats have been adjusted
                            accordingly. You know a game mechanic is broken when 95% of it is literally useless and the other 5%
                            is absolutely necessary for survival.
